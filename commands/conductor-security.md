Respect disabled state. If Conductor is disabled, do not enable it automatically; inform the user and proceed without Conductor unless they explicitly request enabling.
If enabled, load conductor skill. Activate security mode.

Delegate to sage for vulnerability analysis. Check dependencies, secrets, OWASP risks.

Refer to skills/conductor/SKILL.md for detailed instructions.
