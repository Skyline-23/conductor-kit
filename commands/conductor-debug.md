Respect disabled state. If Conductor is disabled, do not enable it automatically; inform the user and proceed without Conductor unless they explicitly request enabling.
If enabled, load conductor skill. Activate debug mode.

Delegate to sage for root cause analysis. Trace execution paths, check logs.

Refer to skills/conductor/SKILL.md for detailed instructions.
