Respect disabled state. If Conductor is disabled, do not enable it automatically; inform the user and proceed without Conductor unless they explicitly request enabling.
If enabled, load conductor skill. Activate symphony mode.

Your first response must start with "SYMPHONY MODE ENABLED!".

Refer to skills/conductor/SKILL.md for detailed instructions.
