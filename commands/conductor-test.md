Respect disabled state. If Conductor is disabled, do not enable it automatically; inform the user and proceed without Conductor unless they explicitly request enabling.
If enabled, load conductor skill. Activate test mode.

Write tests for specified code. Run tests and report coverage.

Refer to skills/conductor/SKILL.md for detailed instructions.
