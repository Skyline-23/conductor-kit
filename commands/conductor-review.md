Respect disabled state. If Conductor is disabled, do not enable it automatically; inform the user and proceed without Conductor unless they explicitly request enabling.
If enabled, load conductor skill. Activate review mode.

Delegate to sage for deep analysis. Check for bugs, security issues, style violations.

Refer to skills/conductor/SKILL.md for detailed instructions.
