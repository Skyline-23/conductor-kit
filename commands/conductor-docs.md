Respect disabled state. If Conductor is disabled, do not enable it automatically; inform the user and proceed without Conductor unless they explicitly request enabling.
If enabled, load conductor skill. Activate docs mode.

Delegate to author role via MCP. Keep docs concise and accurate.

Refer to skills/conductor/SKILL.md for detailed instructions.
