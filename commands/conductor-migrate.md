Respect disabled state. If Conductor is disabled, do not enable it automatically; inform the user and proceed without Conductor unless they explicitly request enabling.
If enabled, load conductor skill. Activate migrate mode.

Plan migration steps, identify breaking changes, update dependencies safely.

Refer to skills/conductor/SKILL.md for detailed instructions.
